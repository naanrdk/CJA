# Customer Journey Analysis (CJA)

## Overview
This Python code provides functionalities for analyzing and managing customer interactions within a system. It includes classes for representing customers, their interactions, and core functionalities for analyzing customer journeys.

## Classes

### Customer
Represents a customer within the system.

- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the customer.
  - `interactions`: List of recorded customer interactions.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self, customer_id)`: Initializes a Customer object with a given customer ID.
  - `add_interaction(self, interaction)`: Tracks a customer interaction with a timestamp and channel.

### Interaction
Represents a customer interaction with a specific channel.

- **Attributes**:
  - `channel`: The channel through which the interaction occurred.
  - `data`: Interaction-specific details.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self, channel, data)`: Initializes an Interaction object with a channel and data.

### cja
Core functionalities for customer journey analysis.

- **Attributes**:
  - `customers`: Dictionary of Customer objects (customer_id -> Customer).

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self)`: Initializes a cja instance.
  - `record_interaction(self, customer_id, channel, data)`: Tracks a customer interaction.
  - `build_journey_map(self, customer_id)`: Constructs a customer journey map based on interactions.
  - `segment_customers(self)`: Segments customers based on behavior and demographics.
  - `predict_behavior(self, customer_id)`: Predicts future customer behavior based on past interactions.
  - `generate_report(self)`: Generates a report on customer journey insights.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Create a `cja` instance.
2. Simulate customer interactions using the `record_interaction` method.
3. Analyze customer journey using `build_journey_map`, `segment_customers`, and `predict_behavior` methods.
4. Generate a report on customer journey insights using `generate_report` method.

## Example
```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create a cja instance
cja = cja()

# Simulate customer interactions
customer_id1 = 123
cja.record_interaction(customer_id1, "website", {"page_viewed": "/products"})
cja.record_interaction(customer_id1, "email", {"email_opened": "Promotional Offer"})

# Analyze customer journey
cja.build_journey_map(customer_id1)
cja.segment_customers()
cja.predict_behavior(customer_id1)

# Generate a report on customer journey insights
cja.generate_report()
